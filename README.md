# Registration Project

This project is a simple registration application built using React.js. It includes four main files:

1. **Signup Pages**: There are two signup pages included in the project. These pages allow users to register by providing necessary information such as username, email, and password.

2. **Login Page**: The login page enables registered users to authenticate themselves by entering their credentials.

3. **Protected Page**: This page is accessible only to authenticated users. It serves as an example of a protected route that requires users to log in before accessing its content.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

This script runs the application in development mode. It opens the application in your default web browser. You can view it at [https://screeningassignment.netlify.app/](https://screeningassignment.netlify.app/). The page will automatically reload when you make changes to the code. Additionally, any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

### `npm test`

This script launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more information on running tests, refer to the [running tests documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

This script builds the application for production to the `build` folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for better performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes for cache busting. Your application is then ready to be deployed. For more information on deployment, see the [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

If you're not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices provided by Create React App, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you full control over them. However, it's essential to understand that you're on your own after ejecting.
